  ParteiPapagei is a simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented
  Generation) application designed to facilitate
  conversations with the political programs of Germany's
  major parties in preparation for the 2025 election
  ("Bundestagswahl"). The app enables users to ask questions
  about proposed party policies and generates responses
  grounded in the respective party programs. Additionally,
  it includes links within the responses, directing users to
  the relevant sections of the programs for verification and
  in-depth exploration. As a supplementary resource, we
  provide the processed and cleaned party programs in
  Markdown format for easy access and use.
