# üó≥Ô∏è ParteiPapagei
ParteiPapagei is a simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application designed to facilitate conversations with the political programs of Germany's major parties in preparation for the 2025 election ("Bundestagswahl"). The app enables users to ask questions about proposed party policies and generates responses grounded in the respective party programs. Additionally, it includes links within the responses, directing users to the relevant sections of the programs for verification and in-depth exploration. As a supplementary resource, we provide the processed and cleaned party programs in Markdown format for easy access and use.

The app is hosted on Streamlit and can be accessed [https://parteipapagei.streamlit.app/](https://parteipapagei.streamlit.app/).
